# PokemonAI
Test ground for reinforcement learning using pokemon showdown.

# Start:
clone the pokemonshowdown repo here: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown <br>
run node ./pokemon-showdown/pokemon-showdown start --no-security in root to start the server
run python scripts at your leisure

-Random and MaxDamage scripts written from poke env examples
-playerml is a combination of examples and pytorch dqn algorithm

#TODO:
-playerml needs better logging of stats ie. amount of dmg taken, number of super effective moves used, etc. Just items to see how well the AI is doing
